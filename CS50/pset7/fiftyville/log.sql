-- Sometime within ten minutes of the theft,
-- I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
-- If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot,
-- you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- As the thief was leaving the bakery,
-- they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that
-- they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
